### Description

Sanity checker script with pretty printing to make sure the farmed seeds are properly aligned. Withing a given set of seeds, for example all the Start Buttons, each seed should be withing a range of 161. This means the lowest seed value is at the maximum 161 smaller than the largest seed value. This double checks my work automatically which saves a lot of tedious manual checking in excel.

### Why 161?

Among all verified seed ranges, no single range seems to exceed 161
